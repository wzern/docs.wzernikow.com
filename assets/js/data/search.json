Any web and mail server allows you to enable data encryption. In this article, we will look at the process of obtaining a free SSL certificate Let’s Encrypt.As initial conditions, you must have a domain name. It’s DNS A-record must contain the public address of your server. If the firewall is enabled, open access for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.sudo ufw allow 80sudo ufw allow 443Installing the “Let’s Encrypt” packageThe process of installing the “Let’s Encrypt” package with all its dependencies is extremely simple. To do this, enter the command:sudo apt install letsencryptAlong with the “Let’s Encrypt” package, this command also installs the “certbot.timer” utility for automatic certificate renewal. It checks the validity of SSL certificates in the system twice a day and extends those that expire in the next 30 days. To make sure that it is running, enter:sudo systemctl status certbot.timerThere are different configurations and conditions for obtaining a certificate. Let’s look at some of them.Standalone server for getting the “Let’s Encrypt” SSL certificateThe easiest way to get an ssl certificate is to use a standalone option in Certbot. Replace domain-name.com with your domain name, run the command, and follow the instructions:sudo certbot certonly --standalone --agree-tos --preferred-challenges http -d domain-name.comThe certonly option means that the certificate will only be obtained without installation on any web server, standalone allows you to start your own web server for authentication, agree-tos means acceptance of the ACME server subscription agreement, which is a prerequisite, and preferred-challenges http means performing authorization using HTTP.Automatic installation of the SSL certificate on nginx and Apache web serversCertbot can automatically install the certificate on nginx and Apache web servers. To do this, you need to install an additional package and choose the appropriate one for your web server.sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginxsudo apt install python3-certbot-apacheRun this command for nginx:sudo certbot --nginx --agree-tos --preferred-challenges http -d domain-name.comOr this for Apache:sudo certbot --apache --agree-tos --preferred-challenges http -d domain-name.comFollow the instructions and Certbot will install an SSL certificate for you.“Let’s Encrypt” Wildcard SSL certificateTo create a wildcard certificate, the only possible challenge method is DNS. In the d parameter, you must specify both the bare domain and wildcard.sudo certbot certonly --manual --agree-tos --preferred-challenges dns -d domain-name.com -d *.domain-name.comAfter that, place the specified TXT record on your DNS server and click continue.If everything is well, you will see the path where your new wildcard certificate is stored and some other information.Information from serverspace.io" }, { "title": "How to Install Uptime Kuma", "url": "/posts/uptime-kuma-installation/", "categories": "docker, containers", "tags": "docker, uptime, monitoring, linux", "date": "2022-08-01 00:00:02 +1200", "snippet": "Uptime Kuma is a self-hosted, open-source, fancy uptime monitoring, and alerting system.

Another monitor I suggest is the ‘TCP Port’ monitor. This is especially useful when hosting things such as a Minecraft Server. You can set the TCP Port Monitor to query the server port (25565 by default for Minecraft) and thus monitor the uptime of your Minecraft Server instance." }, { "title": "How to Install Portainer CE", "url": "/posts/portainer-installation/", "categories": "docker, portainer", "tags": "docker, portainer, containers, linux", "date": "2022-08-01 00:00:01 +1200", "snippet": "Portainer Community Edition is a powerful, open source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.Portainer hides the complexity of managing containers behind an easy-to-use UI.

In this article, you’ll learn 34 basic Linux commands that will undoubtedly help you navigate through Linux as a newbie. pwd command Use the pwd command to find out the path of the current working directory (folder) you’re in. The command will return an absolute (full) path, which is basically a path of all the directories that starts with a forward slash (/). An example of an absolute path is /home/username. pwd cd command To navigate through the Linux files and directories, use the cd command. It requires either the full path or the name of the directory, depending on the current working directory that you’re in. Let’s say you’re in /home/username/Documents and you want to go to Photos, a subdirectory of Documents. To do so, simply type the following command: cd Photos Another scenario is if you want to switch to a completely new directory, for example, /home/username/Movies. In this case, you have to type cd followed by the directory’s absolute path: cd /home/username/Movies There are some shortcuts to help you navigate quickly: cd .. # to move one directory upcd # to go straight to the home foldercd - # to move to your previous directory On a side note, Linux’s shell is case sensitive. So, you have to type the name’s directory exactly as it is. ls command The ls command is used to view the contents of a directory. By default, this command will display the contents of your current working directory. If you want to see the content of other directories, type ls and then the directory’s path. For example, enter ls /home/username/Documents to view the content of Documents. There are variations you can use with the ls command: ls -R # will list all the files in the sub-directories as wellls -a # will show the hidden filesls -al # will list the files and directories with detailed information like the permissions, size, owner, etc. cat command cat (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux. It is used to list the contents of a file on the standard output (sdout). To run this command, type cat followed by the file’s name and its extension. For instance: cat file.txt Here are other ways to use the cat command: cat &gt; filename # creates a new filecat filename1 filename2&gt;filename3 # joins two files (1 and 2) and stores the output of them in a new file (3)cat filename | tr a-z A-Z &gt;output.txt # converts a file to upper or lower case use, cp command Use the cp command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory. For instance, the command cp scenery.jpg /home/username/Pictures would create a copy of scenery.jpg (from your current directory) into the Pictures directory. mv command The primary use of the mv command is to move files, although it can also be used to rename files. The arguments in mv are similar to the cp command. You need to type mv, the file’s name, and the destination’s directory. For example: mv file.txt /home/username/Documents To rename files, the Linux command is mv oldname.ext newname.ext mkdir command Use mkdir command to make a new directory — if you type mkdir Music it will create a directory called Music. There are extra mkdir commands as well: To generate a new directory inside another directory, use this Linux basic command mkdir Music/Newfile use the p (parents) option to create a directory in between two existing directories. For example: mkdir -p Music/2020/Newfile will create the new “2020” file. Information from Hostinger.com" } ]
